## JavaScript Expressions, Operators, and Functions

### Control Flow
* The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
* Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
* A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.

### Functions
* Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

### Operators
* An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.


### Expressions
* An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

* JavaScript has the following expression categories:

- Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, for example 3.14159. (Generally uses arithmetic operators.)
- String: evaluates to a character string, for example, "Fred" or "234". (Generally uses string operators.)
- Logical: evaluates to true or false. (Often involves logical operators.)
- Primary expressions: Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.
- Left-hand-side expressions: Left values are the destination of an assignment.
