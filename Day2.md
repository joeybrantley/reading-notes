# Terminal Cheat Sheet

I learned these things about the Terminal
  1. The pwd command displays the current working directory
  2. There are 2 types of paths to get to files and directories, Absolute and Relative. 
     - The best approach is whichever is the most convenient for you.
  3. The cd command is for change directory.
  4. Everything is a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, 
     your keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only, 
     your monitor is a file (one that the system writes to only).

I learned these things about Text Editors
  1. It's important for developers to be thoughtful about the Text Editor they use to write code.
  2. Text Editors sometimes come with useful features, such as code completion and syntax highlighting.
