## HTML and Wireframes

### **Wireframes**

Today I learned that designing wireframes is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.

They can be drawn with paper and pencil, or at a whiteboard. This is to keep things simple so they can focus on how a user will process information on a site.

### **HTML**

HTML stands for HyperTextMarkupLanguage
It consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear in a certain way, or act in a certain way.

The main parts of an element are:
1. The opening tag
2. The closing tag
3. The content
4. The element

#### **Common HTML Tags**
