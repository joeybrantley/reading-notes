## Operators & Loops

* An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.

* There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)

* A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

* The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

* A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.

* A label provides a statement with an identifier that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program. For example, you can use a label to identify a loop, and then use the break or continue statements to indicate whether a program should interrupt the loop or continue its execution.

* Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement.

* When you use break without a label, it terminates the innermost enclosing while, do-while, for, or switch immediately and transfers control to the following statement.
When you use break with a label, it terminates the specified labeled statement.â€‹
